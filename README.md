## üìù Introduction

The **Library Management System** is a comprehensive command-line application designed to streamline the daily operations of a library. Built using C++, this system efficiently manages books, students, and transaction records, providing librarians with powerful tools to track and maintain their inventory.

This project demonstrates the implementation of fundamental programming concepts including file handling, data structures, and user input validation. The system offers an intuitive interface that allows users to perform all essential library management tasks without complexity.

Key capabilities include book inventory management, student registration, transaction processing for borrowing and returning, and complete activity logging. All data is persistently stored in text files, ensuring that information is preserved between sessions.

Whether for educational purposes or small library management, this system provides a robust foundation for organizing and tracking library resources effectively.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

### Data Structures Used

1. **Book Structure**
   ```cpp
   struct Book {
       int id;
       std::string title;
       std::string author;
       std::string isbn;
       bool available;
   }
   ```
   - `int id`: Unique identifier for efficient retrieval and reference
   - `std::string` fields: Variable-length text for book metadata
   - `bool available`: Binary state optimized for availability checking

2. **Student Structure**
   ```cpp
   struct Student {
       int id;
       std::string name;
   }
   ```
   - Simple structure with minimal fields for student identification

3. **Transaction Structure**
   ```cpp
   struct Transaction {
       int id;
       int bookId;
       int studentId;
       std::string type; // "borrow" or "return"
       std::string date;
   }
   ```
   - Uses `int` references to link books and students
   - String-based type for human readability
   - String date for simplified datetime handling

### Data Collections

- **`std::vector<Book> books`**: Dynamic array for efficient random access by index
- **`std::vector<Student> students`**: Supports iteration and searching
- **`std::vector<Transaction> transactions`**: Chronological record with push_back operations
- **`std::vector<std::string> operationHistory`**: Log storage with sequential appending

### Rationale for Choices

1. **Vector containers** were chosen because they:
   - Provide dynamic resizing for unknown collection sizes
   - Support efficient random access (O(1)) for ID-based searches
   - Allow iteration for displaying and searching records

2. **Integer IDs** were implemented for:
   - Unique identification with simple auto-incrementation
   - Efficient equality comparison for search operations
   - Reduced memory footprint compared to string identifiers

3. **String fields** for textual data offer:
   - Variable-length storage efficiency
   - Built-in memory management
   - Native support for text operations like searching

## üíæ Data Storage

### File Overview

The system uses four distinct text files for data persistence:

| File Name | Purpose | Structure |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| `books.txt` | Stores book catalog | Line 1: Next book ID<br>Subsequent lines: book records |
| `students.txt` | Student registry | Line 1: Next student ID<br>Subsequent lines: student records |
| `transactions.txt` | Transaction history | Line 1: Next transaction ID<br>Subsequent lines: transaction records |
| `operation_history.txt` | System activity log | Each line: one timestamped operation |

### File Structures

1. **books.txt**
   ```
   [next_book_id]
   [id]|[title]|[author]|[isbn]|[available]
   ...
   ```
   Example:
   ```
   5
   1|To Kill a Mockingbird|Harper Lee|978-0061120084|1
   2|1984|George Orwell|978-0451524935|0
   ```

2. **students.txt**
   ```
   [next_student_id]
   [id]|[name]
   ...
   ```
   Example:
   ```
   4
   1|John Smith
   2|Sarah Johnson
   ```

3. **transactions.txt**
   ```
   [next_transaction_id]
   [id]|[book_id]|[student_id]|[type]|[date]
   ...
   ```
   Example:
   ```
   5
   1|2|1|borrow|2025-04-10
   2|1|2|borrow|2025-04-12
   ```

4. **operation_history.txt**
   ```
   [timestamp]: [operation_description]
   ...
   ```
   Example:
   ```
   2025-05-10 14:32:15: Added book: To Kill a Mockingbird
   2025-05-10 14:45:22: Student ID 1 borrowed book: 1984 (ID: 2)
   ```

### File Operations Implementation

- **Read Operations**: Use `std::ifstream` with delimited parsing
- **Write Operations**: Use `std::ofstream` with formatted output
- **Parsing Strategy**: Split by delimiter character (`|`)
- **Error Handling**: Basic verification of file open operations
